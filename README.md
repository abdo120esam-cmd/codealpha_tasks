# First Task: Simple Network Sniffer

# Created by: Abdelrhman Essam Zghloul Saad

My internship at **CodeAlpha** includes this Python script. It uses **Scapy** to record and examine real-time network packets.

## Features
Sniffing live packets from a network interface
- Extracts and shows:
  - Protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP) - Source IP - Destination IP
  Preview of the payload (first 50 bytes)

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites ```bash sudo pip3 install scapy ```

# Launch the application by typing ```bashsudo python3 network_sniffer.py ```

 Use sparingly and only on networks that you have permission to watch.
